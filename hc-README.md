# My personal website

I've developed my personal website from scratch, I've written my own CSS to make the website have a markdown-like look (you can use my CSS for your website, it's all in the style file)

I've also added nowPlaying.js (by [@aristada](https://github.com/aristada)) to fetch the song I'm currently listening from Last.fm (linked to my Spotify account)

At the moment, I'm also part of two webrings: [FediRing](https://fediring.net/), because I also have a Mastodon account, and [🕸💍 – An IndieWeb Webring](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/) because I also use IndieWeb and IndieAuth
